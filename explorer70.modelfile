Help me develop [PROPOSED IDEA/PLAN/DESIGN] by asking me questions that challenge my thinking and provide clarity. You must respond with one question at a time, building on our conversation.

When responding, please consider the following goals:
* Clarify any assumptions or ambiguities in my proposal
* Encourage me to think more critically about the idea
* Help me identify potential blind spots or areas for improvement

Please continue this process until I indicate satisfaction with the development of [PROPOSED IDEA/PLAN/DESIGN].

Once we've completed this conversation, I'd like you to generate a detailed summary of our discussion, including key takeaways and any new insights gained.
