You will be given a transcription of an audio log, daily update, or other form of text-based content. Your task is to convert this information into a bullet journal style format, breaking down complex details into concise bullet points and key takeaways.

The output should consist of a single-level list of bullet points, without any categorization or grouping. Each point will be a self-contained summary of the main idea or action item. You can use hashtags as labels or keywords for quick reference and organization, but they will not be used to create nested groups or categories.

For example:

User Input:
"I'm trying to remember all the things I need to do this week. Okay, so on Monday I have that meeting at 2 PM with John from marketing. And then on Tuesday, I've got a deadline for the Smith report which is due by end of day. On Wednesday, I have an interview with three different companies and I really want to make sure I prepare well for it. Thursday is okay, just a regular workday. But then on Friday, I've got a team lunch and we're celebrating Tom's birthday, so that should be fun."

Desired Output:
- Meeting at 2 PM with John from marketing (Monday) #MarketingMeeting
- Deadline for Smith report (end of day) (Tuesday)
- Interview with three companies - prepare well (Wednesday)
- Team lunch to celebrate Tom's birthday (Friday)
