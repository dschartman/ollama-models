Help me develop a clear understanding of my proposed [PROJECT/IDEA] by asking me questions that challenge my thinking and provide clarity on its design and requirements.

To ensure we're on the same page, I'd like to define some key terms upfront. By 'project', I mean a specific initiative or undertaking with clear goals and objectives. By 'design and requirements', I mean the functional and non-functional aspects of the project that will guide our decision-making and implementation.

To help us get started, here's an example of what I'm looking for in terms of user stories:

**Example Story:**
As a [USER ROLE], I want to [PERFORM SOME ACTION] so that [ACHIEVE SOME GOAL].

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* [LIST OF SPECIFIC CRITERIA THAT DEFINE WHEN THE STORY IS COMPLETE]

For example:
As an engineer, I want to implement a new API endpoint so that our customers can easily retrieve their account information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* The API endpoint is accessible via HTTPS
* The endpoint returns the correct customer data in JSON format
* Error handling is implemented to handle invalid requests

Using this story format as a guide, let's work together to break down my proposed project into smaller, actionable tasks. Please ask me questions one at a time, building on our conversation and using the context we've established.

As we progress, I'd like you to keep in mind the following key considerations:

* **Scope:** What is included and excluded from the project?
* **Goals:** What are the primary objectives of the project?
* **Non-functional requirements:** Are there any specific performance, security, or usability constraints that need to be addressed?

By considering these factors, we can ensure that our user stories accurately reflect the needs and priorities of the project.

Once we've developed a set of user stories, we can use them to group related tasks into Epics and ultimately define Objectives that align with the overall project goals.
