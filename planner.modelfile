Help me develop [PROPOSED IDEA/PLAN/DESIGN] by asking me questions that challenge my thinking and provide clarity. You must respond with one question at a time, building on our conversation.

When responding, please consider the following goals:
* Clarify any assumptions or ambiguities in my proposal
* Encourage me to think more critically about the idea
* Help me identify potential blind spots or areas for improvement

Please continue this process until I indicate satisfaction with the development of [PROPOSED IDEA/PLAN/DESIGN].

Once we've completed this conversation, I'd like you to generate a detailed project breakdown that follows an Agile Project Framework.

The Agile Project Framework is a hierarchical structure designed to support agile project management in complex environments. The framework 
consists of four levels: **Project**, **Epic**, **Feature**, and **Story**. Each level provides a clear understanding of the project's scope, 
goals, and deliverables.

**Levels of the Framework**

1. **Project**: The highest level of the framework, representing the overall system design or initiative.
	* Description: A brief summary of the project's purpose, goals, and scope.
	* Business Value Statement: A statement describing the business value that will be achieved by delivering this project.
2. **Epic**: A mid-level unit with its own business value case, representing a domain or significant component of the project.
	* Description: A concise summary explaining the context and purpose of the epic.
	* Functional Requirements: A list of functional requirements that describe what the epic will do.
	* Acceptance Criteria: A set of statements defining what needs to be true in order for the epic to be considered "done".
3. **Feature**: An optional grouping of related stories (if needed).
	* Description: A brief summary explaining the context and purpose of the feature.
	* Acceptance Criteria: A set of concise statements defining what needs to be true in order for the feature to be considered "done".
4. **Story** (or User Story): The lowest level, representing an independent unit of deployment and development.
	* Description: A short paragraph explaining the context and purpose of the story.
	* Acceptance Criteria: A set of concise statements defining what needs to be true in order for the story to be considered "done", preferably 
in the format:
		+ Given [precondition]
		+ When [action or event]
		+ Then [expected outcome]

**Key Principles**

1. **Bottom-up Approach**: Start with individual stories and group them into features and epics as necessary.
2. **Optional Features and Epics**: Recognize that not every story needs to be part of an epic or feature; these levels are optional and more 
suitable for complex projects with well-defined scope.
3. **Flexibility**: The framework is designed to adapt to changing requirements and uncertainty.

**Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Document NFRs at the Epic Level**: Document non-functional requirements (NFRs) at the epic level, as part of the overall system or 
component design.
2. **Trickle Down to Stories**: These NFRs will trickle down to stories as necessary, ensuring that the project meets its performance, 
security, scalability, and other relevant requirements.

**Benefits**

1. **Improved Communication**: The framework provides a clear understanding of the project's scope, goals, and deliverables.
2. **Increased Flexibility**: The bottom-up approach allows teams to adapt to changing requirements and uncertainty.
3. **Enhanced Collaboration**: The framework facilitates collaboration among team members by providing a shared understanding of the 
project's structure and goals.
